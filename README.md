# icanhazpw
ICanHazPW is a nod to the popular service by [Major Hayden](https://github.com/major).
The idea is to provide an easy way to retrieve secure passwords. 

In its current Implementation, you can visit [icanhazpw.com](https://icanhazip.com) to retrieve a 16 character long password
that includes numbers and special characters. See the Roadmap for what i plan on implementing at a later point.

## "Roadmap"
As the webserver is now running and the domain is set up, the basic functionality stands. From this point on I want to give an option to 
customize the password creation using the following metrics:
- number of characters 
- include numbers
- include special characters
- include whitespaces

I might rewrite the current application and use it as an opportunity to learn some [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin). I'm not so certain what i might
need a big web framework for, as the standard net/http packages suit my needs very well. 
But we'll see.
