# icanhazpw
ICanHazPW is obviously a nod to the popular service by [Major Hayden](https://github.com/major).
The idea is to provide an easy way to retrieve secure passwords. 

## "Roadmap"
So this idea just came in mind. I will start implementing a simple webserver using go as well as securing the domain. 
Just go ahead. 
The webserver will feature a basic REST-api. I'm planning on adding some customization option through a Post reqest. E.g:
- number of characters 
- include numbers
- include special characters
- include whitespaces
- whatever i come up with

## Contributions
Just go ahead.
